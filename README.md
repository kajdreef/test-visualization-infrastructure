Configuration for running the test visualization tool.
It uses nginx, gunicorn, and flask, where flask and gunicorn are running the backend, while the visualization is served directly from nginx.

## Running the tool

- Prerequisites:
    - Install the following tools:
        - Docker
        - Docker-Compose
    - Optional for debugging:
        - curl

- Install by running the following commands:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

- You can also use `docker-compose build --no-cache` to force rebuilding the containers (needs to be done if you want the latest version).

- To make use of the set up we need to resolve the host `spidertest.org` to the ip address docker is running, which should be 127.0.0.1.
For mac os or linux this can be done by adding the following lines to `/etc/hosts`
```
127.0.0.1       morpheus.spidertest.org
127.0.0.1       api.spidertest.org
```

After adding the lines to `/etc/hosts/`, we can test if everything is running using curl:
```bash
curl -v http://api.spidertest.org/generate_204
```

It should generate a 204 response as following:
```
> curl -v http://api.spidertest.org/generate_204
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to api.spidertest.org (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
> GET /generate_204 HTTP/1.1
> Host: api.spidertest.org
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
< Server: nginx/1.19.1
< Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2020 08:16:53 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
<
* Connection #0 to host api.spidertest.org left intact
* Closing connection 0
```

The backend assumes there will be a database called `research.sqlite` in the root directory of this project, created using the [spidertools](https://github.com/kajdreef/spidertools) project.

## Next steps:
1. Make the following files configurable based on a template (e.g., use jinja to create new template):
    - Make `nginx.conf` configurable for local development and production
    - Make `gunicorn_config.py` configurable for local development and production
2. Auto deployment from github
3. Use [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to enable https.
